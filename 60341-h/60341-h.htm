<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>That the Naval Division is worthy of a history
in enduring form is undeniable: that it is
worthy of a historian of more philosophy and
patience is also undeniable. But if the principle
is correct that “any weather is better than none,” as Mark
Twain, who once produced a treatise on navigation which
he called “Following the Equator,” summarized his opinion
of the elements, then it may be correct to allege that
this history is better than no attempt. From newspaper
files which have long lain in unhallowed dust, from scrap-books
long undisturbed, from orders and records and literature
which has received no generic name and from the
lips of survivors of a glorious but ancient day the
historian has drawn the facts which follow. The research
work has been difficult and a task of no mean proportion,
as well, and the work of arrangement and assimilation
has not been inconsiderable, and there is reasonable
excuse for any errors which may appear in the printed
result. For these the historian begs indulgence. He desires
to add that the task has been a pleasant one in spite
of the difficulty and that his only regret is that a history-more
adequate is not the result.</p>

<p class='c013'>In any case the trail has been blazed, or, to use a
more appropriate metaphor, the channel has been buoyed
for him who is destined to produce a suitable volume
when the Second Division shall have arrived at its twenty-fifth
anniversary. That the command may continue
to prosper and that it may ever be as efficient and successful
as in its most honorable days is the earnest wish
of its chronicler.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Thanks are expressed to Lieutenant (Junior Grade)
Charles L. Hogan and Quartermaster Palmer (the division
librarian) of the actives and to Victor F. Morgan,

the collating of material for this little volume. Thanks
are also given to Captain Louis F. Middlebrook and

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the early nineties the so-called, and perhaps miscalled
movement for “Naval Reserves” came into
Connecticut. In 1893 it gathered shape in New Haven
and on the petition of Edward G. Buckland and
forty-four others. General Edward E. Bradley of New
Haven, adjutant-general under Governor Luzon B. Morris,
issued an order for the formation of the First Division,
Naval Militia, C. N. G. In November of that year
a division was organized, a month pregnant with meaning
in the annals of the naval establishment of Connecticut,
for it marked the institution of a branch destined to
endure and to be a just cause of pride to the state of
Hull, Gideon Welles and Foote.</p>

<p class='c013'>The formation of the First Division followed barely
two years after that of the First Naval Battalion in
New York state. Massachusetts had preceded the Empire
State by more than fifteen months, and Rhode Island
by about a year, and when the command in New Haven
organized, the states which boasted naval militia organizations
were Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York,
North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Pennsylvania
and Illinois. The total strength of the naval militia in
these states was about 2,100 officers and enlisted men.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in March, 1890, that the first command of the
kind appeared in Massachusetts, and in the following
May that the Naval Battalion, Massachusetts Volunteer
Militia, pioneer among “Naval Reserve” organizations in
the United States, was organized. From that germ has
grown a system which now includes naval militia bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in twenty-three states and has on the rosters between
seven thousand and eight thousand officers and enlisted
men; and has recorded several times that number of
alumni who are in part trained for the country’s hour
of need on salt water.</p>

<p class='c013'>Interesting stories about the First Division of New
Haven came to the ears of many lovers of salt water in
Hartford. Stories they were of the splendid success of
that crack command, the good times which the fun lovers
of the company enjoyed, the good fellowship shown, the
capacity for hard technical work and the growing esteem
in which it was held both by the adjutant-general’s office
and the Navy Department at Washington. And so it
was that a little knot of similar spirits in Hartford was
formed, men with fondness for yachting on the Sound
or with patriotic pride in the Navy who gravitated
together after a nucleus had been developed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The proposition for a naval company was received
with a diversity of opinion. One military man of ripe
experience raked it fore and aft in print, but in after
years he discovered the error of his range finder and
became a firm friend of the command in fair weather and
foul. His memory long remained green with the company.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>It is recorded that most of the originators of this
movement were employees of the Pope Manufacturing
Company or were members of the Hartford Canoe
Club, and that some were luminaries in a social body
known to fame as The Bachelors, but this last declaration
is disputed. It was on March 14, 1896, that an application
to Governor O. Vincent Coffin of Middletown, Commander-in-chief
of the Connecticut National Guard, for
the establishing of another division was drafted. The
paper was guardedly circulated by Louis F. Middlebrook,
then a member of the Brigade Signal Corps, to whom in
large measure the credit of the subsequent birth of the
command is due. On April 11 the application was presented
to His Excellency together with details as to the
cost of equipment, armory quarters and like matters.
Just eighteen days later the governor’s consent was signified
in an order which Adjutant-General Charles P.
Graham issued for the formation of the Second Division,
Naval Battalion, Connecticut National Guard. That date
is entered in the division’s log as its natal day.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the evening of May 12, Commander Edward V.
Reynolds of the battalion and officers from the division in
New Haven materialized in the even then ancient armory
on Elm Street, never before that night used for any naval
object. A division was formed and officers were elected
as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Lieutenant, Felton Parker.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Lyman B. Perkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ensigns, Louis F. Middlebrook and Robert H. C.
Kelton.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Mr. Parker was a graduate of Annapolis, who had
left the Navy at the reduction in 1882, and was at the
time in the employ of the Pope Manufacturing Company
in the patent department. Mr. Perkins had graduated in
1881 from Annapolis as a cadet engineer. He was a
general agent for the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection
and Insurance Company. Mr. Middlebrook was in the
same company’s employ and possessed large executive
ability. Mr. Kelton was a mechanical engineer in the
employ of the Hartford Rubber Works. He had been a
member of Division C of the First Naval Battalion of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c013'>The division was the armory’s baby and the sailor
uniform and the sailor drill were observed with the
greatest of kindly interest; and, by the way, that interest
survives to this day.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the middle of June the company was in fairish
shape in regard to uniform and equipment, but was shy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of flat caps. On the evening of June 24 the first petty
officers were appointed, the selections being awaited with
the keenest curiosity. The appointees were:</p>

<p class='c013'>First Class—Boatswain’s Mate, Daniel S. Morrell;
Gunner’s Mate, Louis B. Wilson.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Class—Boatswain’s Mate, Edward H. Crowell;
Gunner’s Mate, Walter L. Meek; Quartermasters,
Thomas S. Cheney and Edwin R. Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c013'>Third Class—Gunner’s Mate, Charles D. Rice; Coxswains,
Robert C. Northam, Frank H. Peltier and
Herman F. Cuntz, and Bugler Herbert G. Bissell.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the same June evening, orders were read to stand
by for the division’s first cruise. That duty was on the
U. S. S. Cincinnati, a protected cruiser.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>At 6:45 Saturday morning, July 11, the division
to the number of forty-six entrained for New
Haven and by 8 o’clock was on board the Cincinnati,
as she lay off the breakwater. An hour
later the cruiser weighed anchor and headed down the
Sound, landing the divisions of the battalion on Gardiner’s
Island, where they went into camp. Till late Sunday
evening it was hard work and plenty of it, but the mettle
of the division was shown in the test. Part of Sunday
evening was spent in “hustling ice,” as one member expressed
it in a letter. Near by were naval militiamen
from Rhode Island and New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monday morning found the division embarking for
the Cincinnati, on which instruction was given during the
day in gun, fire and collision drills. For the great majority
of the men it was their first real experience in work on a
warship, and the novelty and excitement were fascinating.
The following day there was drill in pulling boats with
the new coxswains on their mettle.</p>

<p class='c013'>A couple of days more of life in camp and on the Cincinnati
with good weather did much towards starting the
men toward man-o’-war form, or so some of them began
to think. Tanned faces, pipes and plug tobacco came into
full evidence. For some it was, perhaps, a picnic in the
open salt air, but an outing in which discipline was strictly
preserved and much practical information was acquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thursday morning reveille was sounded at Camp
McAdoo at 5 o’clock and simultaneously rain began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>fall. After mess the battalion struck the tents, turned to
on camp gear and transferred nine boatloads from the
island to the Cincinnati. Most of the men were in water
to their waists. Between the fresh and the salt they were
not incompletely drenched, but their hearts were gay and
when the boats were hove up they tailed on the falls
with a will.</p>

<p class='c013'>In New Haven there was a short street parade and
when, in the Meadow Street Armory, the First Division
boys saluted and cheered the Second, the tour of duty
was pronounced to be a glorious success. On the station
platform in Hartford on the arrival of the Second Division
that evening was a motley of fathers and mothers,
kid brothers, best girls and other landlubbers, all eager
to welcome the home-faring tin tars. The men fell in on
the platform and gave this highly original cheer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hi, ye-ke, hi! Ree, Ree, Ree!</div>
      <div class='line'>Naval Battalion, C. N. G.</div>
      <div class='line'>Second Division.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c013'>This may sound at this distant day like a rather
slender battle cry, but the boys of the division ranked it
with the “Brek-e-Ke-Kex” of the Yale Gridiron.</p>

<p class='c013'>The historian admits giving undue prominence to that
tour of duty, but begs indulgence on the ground that it
was the division’s first service on salt water.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In a few months the division was carefully recruited
and when the drill season started it was little effort
for jack o’ the dust to report a tidy sum in the treasury.
The division parlor was artistically decorated.
Along the frieze was painted a stretch of blue water of
dipsy hue on which was developed some of the most startling
advances in shipbuilding. A craft of the time of
Hiero, a Roman galley, a Viking ship, a French frigate of
the sixteenth century, a warship of Revolutionary days,
one of the time of Hull and then the battleship Indiana
were pictured. In a way the series traced the development
of sea power.</p>

<p class='c013'>The months of that drill season wore by pleasantly,
the boys at work mainly at infantry, for somehow in those
days the real province of naval militiamen was not clearly
lined out, but with a bit of single-stick work and some
signalling, and when the end of the season arrived most
of the men were well acquainted with the work which had
been laid out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was on the battleship Maine that the yearly lessons
afloat were learned. The battleship Texas had been
assigned for the duty, but it became necessary to dry dock
her for repairs, and her sister ship took her place. Ensign
Louis F. Middlebrook with Boatswain’s Mate Crowell,
Quartermaster Wightman, Coxswains Osgood and Meek
and Seamen Doran, Mather, J. Morgan Wells, Gilbert
and Baxter constituted the baggage detail, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>sailed from the steamboat landing at 7:30 on the morning
of Saturday, July 17, on the tug J. Warren Coulston for
Fisher’s Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>The detail pitched camp on rising ground in the rear
of the Hotel Munnatawket, not far from the site of the
battalion’s camp some five years later.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Maine lay at anchor in Fisher’s Island Sound.
The remainder of the division went by rail to New Haven
on the following Monday morning and sailed for the
island on the steamer Richard Law. The two divisions
with the engineer branch and the staff made the battalion
nearly 140 strong.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Sigsbee was in command of the ship, the same
officer who was in command when the tragedy in the harbor
of Havana happened seven months later. His face
became familiar to most of our men, as did also that of
Lieutenant Wainwright, executive officer at the time of
the explosion, and when that tragedy came the horror
had a personal as well as a patriotic interest for many
members of the Second Division, who remembered by
name and face many a man in the ship’s complement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the work was at Camp Long or in small
boats, but not a little was on the ship, where gun drill
was among the most interesting of the branches. A lecture
on the Whitehead torpedo was a feature of the
curriculum.</p>

<p class='c013'>One afternoon during the tour of duty on the Maine,
the signal squads of the First and the Second Divisions
met in a contest for a trophy cup and the squad from the
Second won. The winning team included Quartermasters
Cheney and Wightman and Seamen Bosworth and
V. Morgan.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to hark back to the Maine days and to
record that a racing cutter crew was evolved and that it
received some, if not much, instruction and encouragement
from men on the Maine. Out of the mist of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>week it is recorded that this crew was made up of these
oarsmen: First, Seaman Baxter; Second, Quartermaster
Wightman; Third, Coxswain Osgood; Fourth, Seaman
Wells; Fifth, Gunner’s Mate Root; Sixth, Seaman
Havens; Seventh, Seaman Gilbert; Eighth, Boatswain’s
Mate Morrell; Ninth, Coxswain Northam; Tenth, Seaman
Ingalls; Eleventh, Gunner’s Mate Cuntz, and Twelfth,
Seaman J. Morgan. Without experience the crew contested
with the crack twelve of the New Haven Division
and was beaten only by three-quarters of a boat length.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hartford Division returned on the tugs Coulston
and Mabel, arriving at the steamboat landing in the early
evening.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Barely was the next drill season well inaugurated
when the Maine sailed for Havana,
and then came the terrible disaster in which
many of the division’s shipmates were hurled
into eternity, and next the preparation for the
approaching conflict with Spain. In April, the
First Regiment marched away, the division remaining
eager for the coming call. Each drill evening the men
put heart, energy and sustained attention into the work.
Drills took place on the park in the presence of citizens
who paid their tributes of respect to the sailor blue. Each
member was urged to train physically, as well as to learn
the drills. Seamanship, signalling and such boat work
as could be taught were the backbone of the instruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the call came and over ninety per cent. of the
division volunteered at roll call to enlist in the United
States Navy for the entire conflict. On June 6, the division
paraded in heavy marching order up Main Street
and by Trumbull and Asylum Streets to the railroad station,
escorted by posts of the Grand Army and by veteran
and active military commands, and entrained for the State
Military Rendezvous in Niantic.</p>

<p class='c013'>On June 15, Commander Field, U. S. N., mustered in
the command thenceforward known as the “war company.”
Following are the names and the ages with ratings
obtained before the mustering out and with the names of
the ships on which each individual mainly served:</p>

<p>DIVISION BOAT RACE IN BOSTON HARBOR</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>From Niantic the division went to the receiving ship
Minnesota at the Congress Street slip in the Charlestown
Navy Yard. At one time and another officers were detailed
and men were drafted to vessels of the “Mosquito
fleet,” and these were scattered all the way down the
coast to Key West and the Havana Blockade, Ensign
Cuntz on the Sylvia having the good fortune to see the
Morro.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COURSE FOUR<br /> <img src='images/iacorndoodad.jpg' alt='' width='1%' /><br /> <span class='large'>THE PRAIRIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Following the excitement of the war summer
came a reaction. The membership dropped nearly
to the danger point. For a time it was a long and
hard beat to windward, a trying fight with wind,
wave and tide. Like every command from Connecticut
which served in the war with Spain, the division found
many of its best members returning to civilian ranks,
and that to replace them either numerically or in quality
required time and activity. But new blood—or what
might be called a saline infusion—came, and before the
snows melted the division had weathered the worst.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the Prairie which was the division’s floating
home on the cruise taken in the following August. On
the 16th the battalion sailed from New Haven harbor.
Two days later the ship was off Gloucester, home of daring
fishermen, and the next day she was in Bar Harbor.
On the 21st she put out to sea. She passed outside Nantucket
Shoals Lightship and opportunity was given to the
men for target practice with great guns at sea, after sub-caliber
coming full service charges. On their return
members of the division spun exciting yarns concerning
diluted saltpeter, embalmed horsehide, hammock ladders
and raids on the officers’ refrigerator.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is to be chronicled that thirteen states were
represented in naval militia cruises on the Prairie in 1899
and that Connecticut took third rank among them; also
that the Hartford division won first place among the
three divisions from Connecticut, Bridgeport having
organized the Third Division.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER LYMAN ROOT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Probably the most memorable occasion in the
history of the command was September 30, 1899,
“Dewey Day,” the day of the giant procession in
New York City in honor of the fine old hero of
Manila Bay. When the organizations to represent this
state were selected, it was the Naval Battalion which
headed the list of honor. The First Regiment was not
upon the list, but with honorable patriotism officers of
the regiment who had served in Camp Alger requested of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Lieutenant Lyman Root, Lieutenant Parker’s successor,
permission to wear the sailor blue and carry Springfields
in the division ranks. Men who had served in distant
years in the wooden navy and men who had fought under
Dyer in Manila Bay and Wainwright in the combat with
the Furor and the Pluton and had returned to Hartford,
also asked and received the same permission.</p>

<p class='c013'>With four officers and 112 men the division swung
out from the armory on the evening of the 29th and amid
red fire and with a band blaring at the front paraded to
the railroad station, envied by infantrymen who could not
obtain opportunity to march in the mammoth procession.
At 11 o’clock the company marched into the Second
Regiment Armory in New Haven, stacked arms and was
dismissed for a midnight lunch, at which the men stowed
away steaming coffee and ham sandwiches and received
strict orders not to leave the building. Then they made
living pillows of one another and slumbered innocently
on benches in the gallery till some wee, sma’ hour or
other in the morning, when the Second Regiment crashed
out with “Onward Christian Soldiers,” and summoned
them back to the world of consciousness and sin. At
3 o’clock they fell in and marched out into a hospitable
rain punctuated by milkmen and policemen. Three-quarters
of an hour later they boarded the side-wheeler
Shinnecock. At 4 o’clock the steamer got under way
and the men began to look forward to a night of rest.
One man slept on his arm under a table in the dining
saloon piled six feet high with camp chairs. Another
was lost to the world under the break of the pilot house.
Still another slept on unbaled hay for the field officers of
the Second Regiment. Some slumbered in gangways
and some on the paddle boxes. The mathematical boys
of the division demonstrated the problem that it was
possible to sleep anywhere in space.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somewhere in the head of the Sound the Shinnecock
fell on an evil time. A bushing on a feathering paddle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>blade in the starboard wheel misbehaved and a bar
buckled and for three hours she drifted while engineers
made repairs. Finally an emergency landing was made
in a convenient coal yard in Port Morris and the battalion
trotted at double time for two miles over Harlem cobblestones,
arriving just in time to fall in ahead of General
Oliver O. Howard and the Grand Army Division.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the march the men had a coveted opportunity
to view the one-armed corps commander at close range.
Much of the time the old hero was obliged to ride with
his bridle rein in his teeth and with his chapeau in his
hand in response to the frantic waves of applause which
greeted him. The occupants of the closely packed stands
along the line of march rose in wildly cheering masses
as they caught sight of the grizzled veteran and the men
of the Grand Army of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down Riverside Drive and for four miles in the heart
of the city the battalion marched with fixed bayonets.
It paraded between solid masses of cheering citizens and
almost solid walls of flags and decorations. At every halt
the men were refreshed with fruit, coffee or drinkables,
sandwiches and salads or cigars, and presented with
flowers and souvenirs. At one halt on aristocratic Fifth
Avenue a shower of silk college sofa cushions came down
from window seats and a Princeton cushion was impaled
on the historian’s bayonet.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the conclusion of the parade many of the division
repaired to restaurants near Madison Square and Union
Square. Dozens of them found, when they stepped to the
cashiers’ coops to liquidate, that unknown civilians had
obtained their checks and paid the bills. A man in a
sailor uniform in New York City that September afternoon
found it no easy task to spend money. Nothing
was too good for the bluejackets.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is to be recorded that Lieutenant Cuntz, Gunner’s
Mate Huntington, Coxswain Chapin and Seamen
Noble and Nutter preceded the battalion to New York.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>When the Shinnecock failed to appear, they annexed three
stray regulars from the U. S. S. Texas, and assumed an
advanced place in the column. In one of the spectators’
stands certain individuals conceived the notion that the
eight were Hobson and the Merrimac survivors. In a
few moments the word was passed over the stand and the
crowd was on its feet in a wild burst of applause.</p>

<p class='c018'>While Dewey Day experiences were still being talked
over, arrangements were quietly made for a presentation
to the first commanding officer, Mr. Parker, who was
lured to Turnerbund Hall to receive from the command a
gold watch with chain and fob, the chain in the semblance
of a stud-link ship’s cable and the fob a division pin
mounted on a locket.</p>

<p class='c013'>More of the tang of salt air and of the romance of
the ocean came one evening in the next drill season when
the division mustered in the parlor to listen to a talk by
Professor Henry Ferguson of Trinity College, an honorary
member, who told a thrilling tale of shipwreck in the
mid-Pacific. Professor Ferguson recited the story of the
Hornet, a clipper which sailed from New York in 1866
for San Francisco. When the ship was several hundred
miles off the Galapagos fire obliged the crew to take to
the three boats, which were provisioned for ten days.
It was decided to head for the north, to keep in the track
of San Francisco vessels. Merchantmen in those days
adhered to Maury’s sailing directions and it was reasoned
that chances would be better in the sea highway than in
attempting to reach land. By day the heat was nearly
intolerable. Nights were treacherous as they induced
squalls of the vindictively sudden nature peculiar to those
Equatorial waters. Day after day wore by with an unbroken
horizon. Finally the boats crawled up into the
trade winds. It was decided to separate the boats to
increase the chance of finding aid. For twenty-five days
the sailors had fought wind, sun, and water and now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>they were in danger of fighting starvation, the ten days’
provisions, which had been distributed into one-third
allowances, being nearly exhausted. The remaining
provisions were in turn re-divided, but were gone in a
fortnight. The men surviving sought nourishment in
the chewing of leather and moist clothing. On the point
of utter exhaustion they made a landfall, which proved to
be Hawaii, and were rescued by a crew from a coasting
station. They had spent forty-three days in an open boat
and had traveled nearly three thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c013'>More of the romance of the sea came to the division
when the story of a “war member,” William Hurd, and
the schooner Intrepid was told. Less than a month after
Professor Ferguson’s lecture, Hurd cleared in New York
with his little auxiliary as a trader to carry trinkets, tin
jewelry, Yankee notions, canned soups, linens and whatnot
to Baranquila and to acquire cocoanuts and rubber
on the Mosquito Coast and islands nearby. His auxiliary
was sixty-one feet on the water line and eighteen feet
beam and thirty-five gross tonnage, or twenty-eight net.
She had a powerful gasoline motor. After she cleared,
Colombian insurrectionists captured Baranquila and
Hurd’s friends in the division began to wonder what
would happen to their former shipmate if an insurrecto
officer ranged alongside with more of an appetite for
grindstones, canned soups and tin jewelry than for international
law. But Hurd was able to take care of himself.
He prospered as a trader, made a bushel of money, spent
it and finally returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the annual banquet of 1900, Admiral Bunce, U.S.N.,
retired, was a guest and in his speech pointed out
that foreign intelligence officers knew full well that seven-tenths
of the arms and ammunition made for the government
came from Connecticut. In response to a toast
another speaker, Francis B. Allen, said:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>“It was one of your honorary members, our distinguished
Admiral Bunce, who, while in command of the
North Atlantic Squadron just prior to the Spanish War,
brought not only the fleet but each individual ship to such
a degree of excellence in squadron evolutions and gun
drills that he enabled his successors to acquit themselves
so creditably that Sunday morning outside Santiago
Bay when Cervera’s squadron tried to escape that the
result afforded us the greatest Fourth of July celebration
since Vicksburg surrendered.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>A month later Ensign Middlebrook launched the
Veteran Association down well-greased ways, and on
May 23 the battalion had its first field day, assembling at
Savin Rock. It was reserved for Gunner’s Mate Chapin
to make known to Hartford a new method of celebrating
the Fourth of July. He navigated a picked gun crew at
the close of the midwatch from the armory to the City
Hall and at sunrise pumped out a salute of twenty-one
shots from the lean throat of a Hotchkiss one-pounder.
Irate sleepers admitted that Chapin’s method was convincing.
They were justly incensed when he marched
the crew under the Asylum Street bridge and fired a like
salute, and still more so when he took it to the Park
Terrace and discharged a fourteen-shot salute. Chapin
proposed to fire a salute in Wethersfield, but ammunition
ran low.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>That summer’s cruise was on the Prairie and
led to Penobscot Bay. The division sent in a
whaleboat crew to race against one from the
First Division on that water, and its crew
defeated that from the Elm City by a quarter of a length,
one of the New Haven officers marveling at this result
and asserting that it was a mystery of the deep. It also
captured two other boat races.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later in the summer camping parties spent week-ends
in Paradise, the narrow strip between Bodkin Rock and
the river a short distance below Middletown. The division’s
steamboat and the pulling boats which had come a
season or two before were in popular favor. They gave
silent lessons to the boys in boat engine work and in the
stowing of dunnage, thereby adding variety to the oarsmen’s
drill of the early spring.</p>

<p class='c013'>December 22, Lieutenant Parker died at his home in
South Lancaster, Mass. mourned by all who knew him.
A patriotic officer, a loyal friend, he had won the affection
of the command.</p>

<p class='c013'>One minute prior to midnight December 31, two gun
crews unlimbered in the rear of the City Hall and on the
dot of midnight, the opening of the new century, Gunner’s
Mate Chapin fired the first shot in a salute of twenty-one
guns, a welcome to the newborn heir of time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Century No. Twenty’s first gift to the division was
an indoor baseball team. The sport was new to the
armory and it jumped (or slid) into instant favor. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>first game was with a team from Company A and to the
astonishment of everybody and most of all themselves
the sailors won, by a score of 17 to 12. They contended
with a hurricane of batting in the second inning and
dragged anchor, but they weathered the storm and won
with an inning to spare. One of the division advocated
a diamond of this kind:</p>

<p class='c013'>Home plate on the forecastle near the foremast, for
baseline the starboard foremast shrouds and for first base
the foretop; along main topmast stay to second base, the
main top-masthead; down main topmast rigging to third
base, the main top; then down the mainstay and on to the
point of beginning. None of the other teams would play
on that diamond.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a sham battle held in the armory in Governor
McLean’s honor the division had a conspicuous part and
in the spring the battalion had its field day in the South
Meadow. Governor McLean had appointed Mr. Middlebrook
to be naval aide on his staff, with the rank of
captain, the highest rank which any member has obtained
in the Connecticut naval militia, later naval-aides having
the rank of lieutenant-commanders.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COURSE SIX<br /> <img src='images/iacorndoodad.jpg' alt='' width='1%' /><br /> <span class='large'>TO CAMP NEWTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The third anniversary of the mustering in of the
battalion at Niantic was observed by an outing
at Woodmont, followed by a week-end cruise
on the Elfrida, the converted yacht once owned
by W. Seward Webb and purchased by the government
at the breaking out of the war with Spain. At a banquet
in the Pembroke Hotel at Woodmont, General Edward E.
Bradley, adjutant-general when the First Division organized,
and Senator Joseph R. Hawley were speakers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Master-at-Arms Murphy trained a volunteer racing
cutter crew at intervals in the course of the summer,
bitterly lamenting that he never had the same men two
evenings running. Still he had men who were fairly
proficient when the battalion had its annual tour of duty,
at Camp Newton on Fisher’s Island. Tent life was
varied by considerable work in pulling boats. It was
expected that a cutter race would be rowed between the
Hartford racing crew and a crew picked from the New
Haven and Bridgeport Division, but the latter did not
materialize. That spectators might not be disappointed,
two crews were selected from the Hartford oarsmen,
Lieutenant Lyman Root acting as coxswain for one and
Assistant Surgeon Carroll C. Beach for the other.
Mr. Root’s crew was inspired by the presence of Dick,
the division’s mascot, a corpulent bulldog with a blue
flat cap cocked rakishly over one ear. With one hand on
the tiller and the other on the dog’s collar, Mr. Root
incited his crew and won by a half-length in a course of
half a mile.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>For most of the six days rain came down in buckets.
The camp work was a practical lesson to the men of the
division. That they returned healthy, well disciplined,
and contented, as well as much more familiar with duty
either afloat or ashore, demonstrated the learning capacity
of the men and the value of the camp.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the return the Elfrida cast off, outside Saybrook
Light, a tow consisting of the steam whaleboat and the
division’s cutter, its barge and its pulling whaleboat.
The “whaler” with the pulling boat in tow started up the
river, but a squall descended and gave work to all hands.
The crews landed in Essex in torrents, and after making
the boats snug for the night, turned in at a sail loft near
the landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the autumn the division sustained another severe
affliction in the death of its first honorary member, a firm
friend in fair weather and foul, Admiral Francis M.
Bunce, an officer whom it had been a rare privilege to
honor. A veteran of the Civil War, a seasoned sailor,
a loyal Hartford man who took pride in his townspeople,
the Admiral had richly merited the division’s high esteem.
His strong, yet kindly face the men missed and mourned.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the autumn an order came for a parade in New
Haven, and when the personal escort for President
Roosevelt was selected, it was found to be the Naval
Battalion; and when the parade started it was found that
the senior division, the Second, was next to the
President’s carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wall-scaling had a conspicuous part in the drill of the
winter, and in the spring small boat work and volunteer
work on the Elfrida, the battalion’s practice vessel, were
attractions for those most interested in the command.
The Elfrida played her part well in the duty of the
spring field day of 1902, when the battalion rendezvoused
in Bridgeport.</p>

<p>CAMP PARKER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>In June of that year a proposition to establish a
summer camp took shape and at a meeting a subscription
paper was opened and $200 was pledged in about fifteen
minutes. A site was selected on the east bank of the
river in South Glastonbury and nearly opposite Two
Piers. Volunteers cleared the land of brush, assisted in
driving a well, hauled lumber and materials up the steep
ascent of 115 feet, aided the carpenters, and helped to
furnish and arrange camp. They sought and obtained
practical experience in cooking and camp life. It was
decided to name the camp after the first commander of
the division; and to this day the building is known as
Camp Parker. The spot was formally dedicated July 4th
with speeches and an open-air dinner, at which the building
committee in due and ancient form turned the institution
over to the division. The house was equipped with
hammocks and many a rooky has there learned how to
pass a sailor’s night. Many a pleasant Sunday afternoon
in midsummer has lured men of the division to the cool
piazza with its noble view for many miles in three directions,
south, west and north.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In some respects the yearly cruise which started
several weeks later was among the most memorable
adventures of the division; and when some of the
old hands are spinning yarns about what they did
when they were young, they like to hark back to the
“sham war” and a certain hike across Montauk Point.
The most extensive land and sea maneuvers in many
years were arranged in Washington for a force of several
thousand of the army and for practically all of the fine
North Atlantic squadron of that year, of which Admiral
Higginson, the captain of the Massachusetts in the Spanish
war, was in command.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was on the auxiliary cruiser Panther that the
battalion served. The division boarded the ship in New
London harbor. In the course of the service the Panther
steamed as far east as Menemsha Bight and as far west
as New London, the object of the maneuvers being to
test in a practical way the defenses of the eastern entrance
of Long Island Sound. At sundown of a Saturday the
most powerful fleet to that time assembled in those
waters was riding to anchor in the bight, awaiting the
passage of the hours before midnight ’ere beginning
maneuvers against the string of forts and signal stations
scattered all the way from Woods Hole around to Montauk.
As night shut down, the signal lamps began their
Ardois work. At midnight hoarse orders came from the
Panther’s bridge and the rattle of the steam winch and
the heavy clank of the cable in the hawse pipe announced
that the ship was getting under way.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Sunday found the ship off Block Island and Monday
evening found her heading north. Just as the watch off
duty was beginning to snore peacefully, the bugle sounded
the call for general quarters. In a moment the gun deck
lights were switched on and ladders and hatches were
choked with men piling to their stations. Masters-at-arms
were unceremoniously rousting out rookies from their
hammocks. In barely more time that it has taken to
write this paragraph the guns were cast loose, ammunition
was provided and the big naval bulldog was in fighting
trim.</p>

<p class='c013'>One afternoon the battalion had boat drill. Cutters were
lowered and with boat guns working and the landing party
armed with rifles there was a pretty bit of excitement.
A day later the heavy guns belched at a signal station
ashore, which crumbled to theoretic dust. Then the naval
militiamen were mustered at division quarters and a day’s
ration was issued to each man, a two-pound tin of canned
beef to each pair of men and five or ten hard tack (or
ship biscuit) to each man and a canteen full of water
or coffee, as the man elected. The call came for arm and
away boats. With a Colt automatic in the bow of each
cutter the party landed, going into extended order, while
a detail took possession of the telegraph and the telephone
station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The long line of blue swarmed over a strip of sand
and a bit of swale to a knoll. Then began two hours’
hard work. Through wire grass and sand grass, through
bushes and brush, across swamp and swale, by farmhouses
and barns, alongside lily ponds, the bending blue
line advanced, officers pointing the way with swords and
squad leaders attempting to keep the files at eight pace
intervals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following an advance of four miles in such manner
the “enemy” was located behind the crest of a steep and
high hill. The order for a charge was given and with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>yell the men sprinted forward under a heavy shower of
fireworks. Ensign Northam was the first up San Juan
Hill and it was reported that the historian was the last
to reach the summit.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this juncture the heavens opened and rain came
down in buckets. After a quarter of an hour in the
downpour the battalion started on the return of four
miles. The hike was at route step. At the beach the
oarsmen had a stiff pull against wind and tide in boats
loaded to the gunwales. But the young salts were in
fine spirits and when the order came to “shift to anything
dry” it was received as a joke.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chief boatswain’s mate of the Panther was C. K.
Claussen, the Claussen who accompanied Hobson on the
Merrimac and was confined in the Spanish prison near
Santiago.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of the week, when the Panther left the
squadron, her course lay between the Olympia, Dewey’s
flagship in the Battle of Manila Bay, and the Brooklyn,
Schley’s in the capture of Cervera. To each was given a
salute with the bugle and the lining of the rail. The
Brooklyn’s band rendered a patriotic air.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the following fall the division took up target
practice in real earnest and at a special shoot in the South
Meadow Chief Gunner’s Mate Herbert E. Wiley won
the first place. Barely was this function over when it
was decided to produce a comic opera and “The Mikado”
was selected. This was presented in Parsons’, so well
that critics agreed that the division could sing as correctly
as it could sail.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the winter the division tried its fortune again at
indoor baseball, with varying results. On one occasion
it played an exciting game with Company A, won the
game, lost it and won it again, just clearing a lee shore
by a score of 19 to 18. On another it defeated the champions
of the armory in an eleven-inning contest.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The second annual indoor meet demonstrated that the
series had arrived to stay, a fact which each February
proves again.</p>

<p class='c013'>To extend its activities the division sent a picked gun

<p>BOAT CREW AT CHARLES ISLAND</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The field day was spent at Charles Island. To still
further extend its activities the division crossed afoot
from the island at low tide to the mainland.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Amphibious is the word to apply to the division’s
tour of duty that summer. The steam
whaleboat, by this time christened “Tillie
Hadley,” by her fireman, Gunner’s Mate Arnold,
started down the river August 21, 1903, with the three
pulling boats in tow, carrying nearly a quarter of the
division. The following day the remainder boarded the
Elfrida in New Haven harbor, and she with the First
Division’s small boats in tow steamed to Crescent Bay.
A detail from each division spent eight days afloat and
the rest divided their time between Camp Reynolds at
the state military rendezvous at Niantic and boat drills
in Crescent Bay. The boat work was popular, so much
so that in a few days most of the oarsmen were approaching
man-o’-war form.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of the duty a storm came along which
gave work to militia, the seafaring population and landlubbers.
In the New York <cite>Herald</cite> of the next day it
was printed: “Old seafaring men down that way say
that they never saw the Sound rougher than it was that
night.” A sailboat was washed ashore at White Beach,
two small sailing vessels dragged anchor near Niantic,
a sloop was wrecked to the southwest of the Crescent
Beach landing and a large three-masted schooner dragged
anchor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Elfrida steamed out of the bay as the storm was
breaking, on her way to Sandy Hook and the yacht races
with Governor Chamberlain on board. The sou’wester
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>rose into a gale. Seas broke high over the weather rail
to fly across the engine room skylight. The officers on
the bridge and the quartermaster on watch were soon
soaked to the skin in spite of oilskins and pea coats.
It was a fierce night and the brave little ship had a nervy
tussle with the gale. At 3 o’clock in the morning the
Elfrida put into Huntington Bay and dropped anchor,
finding that five large steamers were there riding out
the night, among them the Tremont of the Joy Line,
and the Shinnecock. Stormbound sailing craft were also
in the bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after the hook went down it was found to be
dragging, then the ship was taken farther inshore and
both starboard and port anchors were let drop, with a
good length of cable.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later a distress sign was sighted on a yacht out in
the open water. A volunteer boat crew pulled out and
found the vessel to be the schooner Rosina, from New
Haven, owned by an amateur who had a sailing master,
three women and a cook on board. The owner seasick,
the sailing master called the cook for a moment to the
wheel, while he stepped down into the cabin for a chart.
The cook lost his head and, while in the wind, the
schooner’s main-topmast snapped and her fore-topsail
carried away. The rescuing boat crew found the women
hysterical and with life preservers adjusted. The men
from the Elfrida cleared away the wreckage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early in the fall the division entertained members of
H Company, Naval Brigade, M. V. M., of Springfield, at
Camp Parker with an old-time shore clambake. The camp
had become increasingly popular and for a number of
years nearly every Saturday or Sunday afternoon in
midsummer attracted division men to the place, and in
“whites” the boys kept busy making things snug in the
galley or policing the grounds or taking a spin in a
pulling boat below.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>November 18 brought an extraordinary spectacle—a
book bee. At our bell in the first watch, Librarian Palmer
and Jack-o’-the-Shelf McDonald broke out their accessioning
system and the smoking lamp was lighted. The
books given made a startling list. Tolstoy’s “Resurrection”
was found sandwiched between “Alice in Wonderland”
and a volume of Lighthouse Reports. General
Miles, Kipling, Morgan Robertson and Roosevelt were
popular authors. This is history, not romance. An
entertainment followed the book bee. Clog dancing on
the foc’s’le head, nautical songs, selections on cordage
and dead eyes by a banjo quintet and a sword dance by
Coxswain Watson made up the backbone of the evening.
It was seven bells when the rejoicing ceased and the
merrymakers heaved out of the armory, all on soundings
and under easy canvas, except the supposed contributor
of “Resurrection,” who scudded away under a double-reefed
fore-topsail.</p>

<p class='c013'>The indoor meet of the next February sustained the
division’s reputation. By this time the annual mid-winter
tourney had become known all over Connecticut. The
referees in the series have included such gentlemen as
President Luther of Trinity College and Former Lieutenant-Governor
Lake.</p>

<p class='c013'>A month later the division was entertained by
H Company of Springfield in the Highland Hotel in that
city, where the company was observing its eleventh
anniversary.</p>

<p class='c013'>In June (June 19, 1904) the Elfrida came over Saybrook
Bar with Lieutenant Lyman Root in command. She was
navigated up the river by members of the division and
came to anchor opposite the foot of Ferry Street. Three
days later, a brilliant reception was given on board her
to Governor Chamberlain. She was dressed fore and aft
and from water’s edge to water’s edge. In the illumination
248 Japanese lanterns were included. Many military
officers were present in full dress uniform.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The following morning the division paraded to the
foot of Ferry Street, embarking and escorting the governor
and Former Governor Morgan G. Bulkeley, an
honorary member of the division, to East Haddam, there
to attend the dedication of a monument to Major-General
Joseph Spencer of Revolutionary War fame.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three days later a hard-working and loyal graduate
of the division, Ensign William G. Hinckley, assistant
engineer, received his commission as lieutenant and chief
engineer. Efficient, loyal and popular, Mr. Hinckley
received numerous congratulations of his well-earned
promotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The range of the division’s energy is proved when it
is chronicled that July 27, the clubhouse committee
carried out a moonlight sail down the river. It was
considerately promulgated in the committee’s circular:
“State exact number of ladies you intend bringing.
Chaperons will be in attendance.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The yearly cruise of 1904 was on Farragut langsyne
flagship, the Hartford, relic of the battle
of Mobile Bay.  It was as interesting as any
which the division has ever taken, barring,
perhaps, that on the Panther. When station billets were
issued even the old hands volleyed questions at their
running mates of the regular crew. Here is the start of
a typical station billet:</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a novelty to nearly all of the division, bringing
back the old days of heave and haul. The regulars were
husky men with legs like barrels and arms like blacksmiths’,
nearly every one raw material for a football player
or anchor of a tug-of-war team. Bosn’s mates were
weather-beaten salts with faces like teakwood, seamed
by the suns and snows of the seven seas, tanned tar-mequicks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>with chests like hair mattresses. One barnacle in
the port watch had a voice as rasping as a nutmeg grater.
You might have imagined that he was born in Lat. 2,
North, Long. 2, West, and that he learned to creep on
the lee side of the foc’s’le. When he shrilled out a pipe
with a chaser like the growl of distant thunder a nippous
rooky from the Tenth Ward asked in blank amazement:</p>

<p class='c013'>“What in heaven did that fellow say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One man from each part of the ship coal the first
steamer,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the best boat work which the division has ever
done was performed on this cruise. This is true not only
in the line of oarsmanship, but also in the securing of
boats for sea and for port.</p>

<p class='c013'>The duty took the division up Sound to Huntington
Bay, then east to Gardiner’s Bay, thence over to New
London and finally back to New Haven harbor. The men
had a welcome convenience in the line of large lockers.
They took much interest in the apprentices, frolicsome
little fellows then from the training station who had
school each morning at a mess table on the starboard side
of the gun deck near a frowning five-inch gun with its
glittering brass and its oiled steel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The boys were poring over their books and papers
in very much the same way that lads in the seventh and
eighth grades in the Second North or the West Middle
schools are poring (perhaps more so), over arithmetic.
In the instruction of the class the chaplain was using some
of the books which citizens of Hartford gave to the
ship’s library in 1899 at the suggestion of Admiral Bunce.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most important among the events of the early part
of the ensuing drill season was the election of Lieutenant
Lyman Root to be navigator of the battalion to succeed
Lieutenant Robert E. L. Hutchinson, promoted to
be lieutenant-commander and in turn succeeding
Lieutenant-Commander Frank S. Cornwell, promoted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>be commander of the battalion, <i>vice</i> Commander Averill,
retired. In his capacity as chief of the division, Mr. Root
had shown exceptional versatility, having been successful
in the social and athletic lines, as well as in drill and discipline.
At the next drill evening he took formal farewell
of the division which he had so long and so ably
and so considerately commanded, giving generously of
his best energy and most faithful loyalty. He had taken
the helm when the command was little better than a
wreck, had nursed it back to health and prosperity and
made it the finest military company in all Hartford. In
fair weather and foul weather, in joy and sorrow, on
soundings and off soundings, his steadying hand had
been at the wheel and had time and again brought the
division safe into port. Strong and clear purpose, affection
for the command and for salt water,—these were our
chief’s dominant traits. The ability to read character
was another quality. But of these three characteristics
his affection for the division stood ever foremost.</p>

<p>LIEUTENANT HOWARD J. BLOOMER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Captain Howard J. Bloomer came over from the
infantry to act as next lieutenant of the division, not the
least of the prerogatives being the privilege of presiding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>as toastmaster at the yearly banquet. On the menu card
was a huitrain re-rigged from Coxswain John Kendrick
Bangs so as to read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c013'>A floral bell nearly as large as the foretop was lifted
and revealed an elegant silver loving cup presented to
Mr. Root as testimony to their high esteem. A little later
followed the elevation of Mr. Root to the rank of
lieutenant-commander of the battalion.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Sail drill was the feature of the cruise on the Hartford
in 1904 and in the following year drill in
small boats was the feature. On the training ship
the boats usually hung outside the rail, but on the
cruiser the boats were frequently kept inside the rail.
With the ship’s four funnels and her multitudinous skylights
and deckhouses her superstructure was unsuitable
for “setting up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A series of tug-of-war pulls enlivened the trip. The
New Haven division won from Bridgeport and Hartford
from New Haven. Thus it was for the Hartford team to
pull the ship’s team. This contest came and to the
astonishment of all, the Hartford men won. And so it
was that when the division returned half of the lads were
hoarse.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bugler L. Wayne Adams was in high feather during
the trip. He had memorized the calls and sounded them
accurately. By virtue of his high office he was excused
from previous service as messman; for much of the
cruise he was a man of elegant leisure. On his return to
Wethersfield, residents of Jordan Lane and the Nail Keg
Club at Hanmer’s grocery heard many a fine yarn, spun
in Wayne’s best style.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old rifle range in the South Meadow was discontinued,
owing to the increased range and power of the
rifles just introduced into the Connecticut National
Guard. In consequence the division’s fall target practice
was conducted over the range in South Manchester. Acting
as a marker, Landsman Hill was hit by a deflected
bullet, which was found later in his shoe. Hill was taken
to the Hartford Hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Following the indoor meet, given successfully, of
course, the division began to prepare to celebrate its
tenth anniversary. The banquet was held in the Hartford
Club. In the blue uniform the men of the division
attending mustered for entry into the dining room, to
the strains of a march. A dismounted signal gun of old-time
size from the Dauntless rested at the center of the
head table, flanked by two silver cups, trophies won by
athletic teams from the division. Knife bayonets of the
new kind rested on the cups. Two stacks of rifles afforded
resting-place for the division’s colors.</p>

<p>LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER ROBERT D. CHAPIN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the early spring Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Robert
D. Chapin succeeded to the command of the division. In the
nine years he had been in the division he had ascended the
ladder, round by round, as seaman, coxswain, gunner’s
mate, second and first class, and boatswain’s mate, first
class. He had served on about every brand of standing
committee which the organization had utilized. Later he
was appointed naval aide with the rank of lieutenant-commander.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again in the early summer a racing crew was essayed,
with Boatswain’s Mate Hogan in charge of the training,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the course extending from an imaginary line off the old
pumping station below Riverside Park to a point off the
East Hartford bank about a quarter of a mile above the

from the bridge.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Mr. Chapin’s cruise was on the Minneapolis,
sister ship to the Columbia, and it started on
August 25, 1906, from New Haven harbor.
The ship steamed down the Sound and by Race
Rock Light and anchored off Block Island in the evening
with the port anchor, in seventeen fathoms, sixty fathoms
of chain out. A protected cruiser, the Minneapolis did
not rate a band, but she carried one till the Dolphin came
along and commandeered the musicians. The next day
the ship steamed out to sea for a hundred miles and then
after a diversity of courses came to anchor in Menemsha
Bight. Target practice, while the Minneapolis was steaming
at a rate of ten knots, made one afternoon’s work. In
it the division’s team struck hard times, but in the signal
contest later the division redeemed itself, Quartermaster
Palmer being an easy first among the signal force of the
battalion in the Ardois branch and Quartermaster Ferris
making an especially fine showing with the semaphore
work. The division has for several years been strong
in the signal branch.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Governor Woodruff chose a naval aide it was
Mr. Chapin who was selected for that high honor, and
when the next commanding officer of the Second was
nominated, Dr. Beach moved up to a lieutenant’s stripes.
Beginning in the ranks Dr. Beach went upon the staff as
assistant surgeon and then back to the Second as ensign.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a number of years the division had combined with
other commands in the Elm Street Armory to attend an
annual military service in a Hartford church, but in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>following December it decided to attend a separate or
sailors’ service, and the church of the Rev. Dr. Main was
selected. It is a question why this was chosen, but a
legend has it that the choice was on account of the
nautical hint in the pastor’s name and that in the denomination,
the Baptist. In a sermon on intelligent patriotism
Dr. Main interspersed a number of sailorlike yarns to
illustrate several points. He told the story about Nelson’s
disregard of Parker’s signal at the battle of Copenhagen;
and that of John Paul Jones’s answer in the fight with the
Serapis.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most loyal and faithful members the
division ever included had enlisted a short time before in
the United States Navy, Seaman John J. A. Connor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>was now on the battleship Connecticut on the always
memorable trip around the world, bombarding friends
with welcome post cards.</p>

<p class='c013'>The eleventh anniversary banquet was enjoyed in the
Hotel Garde in conjunction with Admiral Bunce Section,
Navy League of the United States. Admiral Caspar F.
Goodrich told about his personal interest in the Naval
Militia, an adjunct necessary to the Navy, as he declared,
and Corporation Counsel Arthur L. Shipman talked as an
attorney to the gathering, telling about the influence of
the navy in Guam and Samoa, where the Navy was still
administering the government.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COURSE TWELVE<br /> <img src='images/iacorndoodad.jpg' alt='' width='1%' /><br /> <span class='large'>AGAIN THE PRAIRIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Space has been economized for the chronicling of
the next cruise, a trip on our old friend the Prairie
to Hampton Roads. For several seasons the naval
militiamen had prospered with running mates
from the regulars, but for a reason to be made evident in
the next sentence the pair-off system was not pursued this
time. The Prairie had a skeleton crew of 145 and the
battalion numbered about fifty above those figures. The
start for the run down the coast was made by way of
Montauk Point, rounding which the Prairie put her helm
over for the first long leg on a course of S. 58 degrees W.
Early in the evening the wind began rising and old hands
watched the rookies for symptoms of internal disturbance.
The journey down was a welcome innovation and the
passing of Five-Fathom Bank Lightship and of Winter
Quarter Lightship were events. When the Cape Charles
Lightship came abeam the Prairie went on various courses
until she dropped anchor off the Chamberlin Hotel at Old
Point Comfort. During a part of the run soundings were
made by the Thompson sounding machine, a method that
had been studied in former cruises, but with less interest
than on this. The Jamestown ter-centenary was in
progress that summer and liberty to an unusual extent
was allowed to the battalion. One afternoon about fifty
members of the division visited the Connecticut building
at the exposition. Most of them signed their names in
the register, Boatswain’s Mate Perkins at first directing
the writing class and, when he tired, another petty officer
relieving him. It was with joy nearly equal to signing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the pay roll that the sailors affixed their signatures.
Manager Curtis greeted the men with a graceful courtesy
rivalled only by Commissioner Barber’s graceful urbanity.
Maps of the exposition grounds were served out. By
using these and keeping the lead going and working their
jaw tackle, the men made shift to reach proper destinations.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>LIEUTENANT (JUNIOR GRADE) CHARLES L. HOGAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The same afternoon the men gravitated to a military
carnival on the parade. An impression prevailed in the
division that the division’s tug-of-war team could have
outpulled the team which won in the carnival.</p>

<p class='c013'>In years gone by cruise clubs had been launched, for
instance the Ham-Bone Club at Fort Wright and the
Fore-Top on the Hartford. In Jamestown the Kimona
Club was organized with Lieutenant Hinckley at its head.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>It consisted of a president, a vice-president, a secretary
and a chancellor of the exchequer, with an understudy for
each.</p>

<p class='c013'>On another afternoon Commissioner Barber made his
return call. He witnessed hammock and dunnage bag
inspection, a “ceremony” which our men loved as
cordially as the devil loves holy water. He saw, also,
Underwood typewriters in the paymaster’s office and
rejoiced at the use of a Hartford product.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the fall information came that the Elfrida was to
leave Connecticut waters and that the unarmored gunboat
Machias was to take her place as the battalion’s practice
ship. The new ship was built in Bath, Me., in 1892. She
is of steel, has two masts. Her length is 204 feet, her
beam 32 feet, her mean draft 12 feet, her displacement
1,777 tons, her net tonnage 398, her speed 15½ knots
and her horse power 1,484. She has accommodations for
nine officers and about 132 men, or about six times as
many men as the Elfrida could sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Christmas tree in the division parlor brought joy to
all hands and astonishment to not a few. It was accompanied
by an innocuous punch of pink tea caliber, followed
by Mother Carey sandwiches, saltpeter and frozen rating
badges (Neapolitan ice cream). Skylights were closed,
all glims were doused and current was turned on for
small electric lamps in a hemlock, which had been decorated
with marlinspikes, rope yarns, and cornucopias.
Lieutenant (Junior Grade) James A. Evans, rigged gaily
as Santa Claus, served out gifts from the break
of the quarter deck, assisted by Boatswain’s Mates
Perkins and Wyllie and Gunner’s Mate Dickerman. Mr.
Hinckley received a miniature Tillie Hadley. Mr. Hogan
was presented with a milk wagon. To Seaman Barnes
was given a rake. Gunner’s Mate Dickerman, who held
the championship of the fleet at the deck game of
bowling, was helped to a children’s set of tenpins. Quartermaster
Palmer, impressario of the Banzai orchestra, drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>an accordion. A village character in the company received
an allowance of jaw tackle. A certain apprentice seaman
was the recipient of a “hammock ladder,” which dates
back to the berth deck of Father Noah’s Ark.</p>

<p class='c013'>March 17, 1908, an order was issued from the
adjutant-general’s office marking the passing of the
“battalion.” The official title of the force was changed to
Naval Militia, Connecticut National Guard. Ratings
were officially prescribed, those of the first class in the
division being the following: Master-at-arms, boatswain’s
mate, gunner’s mate, machinist’s mate and water-tender.</p>

<p class='c013'>May 21 the Tillie Hadley was taken to Saybrook and
exchanged for the First Division’s steam cutter. Later
the Tillie went to the New York Navy Yard. The
departure of the old steam whaleboat marked the passing
of one of the company’s time-honored institutions. The
boat’s successor is variously known as the Hallie Tidley
and the Merry Widow.</p>

<p class='c013'>The observance of a division memorial day began this
year, actives and veterans assembling at noon, May 30th,
for a service, and parading in the afternoon as part of
the escort to the Grand Army of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>In midsummer a movement came to reorganize the
Veteran Association. A meeting was held July 24th
and the project advanced at a second meeting held a week
later, when the matter of participating in the approaching
dedication of Hartford Bridge was discussed. Former
Ensign Fred E. Bosworth was chief oiler of the
machinery.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Once more it was on the Prairie that the company
cruised. It was the fourth time, once to Bar
Harbor, once to Penobscot Bay, and once to
Hampton Roads. So often has the ship been
the company’s floating home, that long-service members
are more familiar with her than with any other ship in
the Navy, unless it be the Machias.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the company were men from naval militia in
New York City and Brooklyn, congenial companions,
with more of naval wardrobe than the Second Division
showed. The cruise was mostly in the Sound. The
ship was engaged in squadron maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c013'>A flotilla of six torpedo boats accompanied the squadron,
as did also four submarines. Boats of this kind were
in 1908 comparatively new to many in the company, and
when Ensign Hogan found an opportunity to make a
descent in a submarine he embraced it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Back in Hartford the men grew busy in preparing for
the Bridge Dedication, the most important festivity
which the city has ever conducted, to which the command
voted to invite its old nautical guest, H Company of
Springfield, down.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dedication opened October 6 with the firing of a
salute, by the division, of course. In the evening the
division paraded in a historical pageant, the men representing
men-o’-wars men of the conflict of 1812.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battalion paraded in the giant military procession
of October 8 as a landing party, marching in white hats,
and being among the warmest favorites in the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>column. In the afternoon it banqueted in the Y. M. C. A.
with H Company men, for whom the division’s poet
laureate had evolved a lyric, of which the following is a
specimen verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When dinner’s o’er, we then will go, then will go, then will go,</div>
      <div class='line'>When dinner’s o’er, we then will go, to East Hartford’s sandy shore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While the company was beating up Pearl Street, an
automobilist rammed the hospital apprentice, an incident
which developed an aftermath in the superior court
when with a former Philippine soldier, Sergeant Benedict
Holden, as attorney and counselor and proctor in
admiralty, McIntyre got a verdict. In his argument
Sergeant Holden commended the division as a patriotic
command in which the city might well take pride.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>ANOTHER CHRISTMAS TREE</h3>

<div class='c004'></div>
<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>Jan’y 4, 1909—Fourth Day Out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lat. 41° 49′ N. Long. 71° 36′ W. Bar., rising; Wind,
E. S. E.; Atmos., Smoky. All hands happy. Thus ends
this Day.—[Extract from the Division’s Log.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>At eight bells in the second dog watch all hands were
piped to the fo’c’sle. On the forecastle-head two screen
cloths were rigged on a sliding gunther brace. Being
drawn, these disclosed Master-at-Arms Perkins in the
capacity of Neptune disguised as Santa Claus. By the
heel of the bowsprit were the crosstrees, which had been
sent down and rigged with rope yarns and stores from
the canteen. Around the tree and along both rails
packages were stowed facing inboard, made fast with
marlin and manila. Pipes, matches and tobacco were
served out and the smoking lamp was lighted. Then gifts
were passed out. Dr. Beach received a box of pills,
Coxswain Burns a masthead light, Master-at-Arms
Perkins twin dolls, one young Benedict a toy baby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>carriage, and Watertender Lewis a slice bar. Gifts wise
and otherwise were passed till the supply was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Skylarking such as this varied the serious work of
the drill season. Although the membership of the
command from time to time changed to some extent, the
majority of the men had been in the division for years
and were fairly proficient in seamanship as well as in the
ordinary armory routine, and it must not be imagined
that their fun interfered with their nautical work.</p>

<p class='c013'>The diversity of the fun is proved when allusion is
made to a game between the division’s new basketball
team and the Boston Bloomer Girls’. It was chronicled
that not a member of the girls’ team lost a backcomb or
displaced a “rat,” although their hair was coiled like the
flemished-down end of the Elfrida’s topping lift.</p>

<p class='c013'>The indoor meet was the last held in the old armory.
It was as creditable as any in the long and popular series
and went as smoothly as desired.</p>

<p class='c013'>June 13 was observed as Memorial Sunday, the first
which the division formally kept. The company reported
at the armory to act as escort to the veteran company in
a parade to Spring Grove Cemetery.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>So near is the history drawing to the present that
merely a bare outline is given here of the next
two years. The cruise of the summer of 1909
was on the Machias and took the division to quaint
old Provincetown. The Pilgrims’ Tower and the swimming
linger in the men’s memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Members of the company enjoyed three days’ duty at
the Hudson-Fulton celebration in New York City. In
December the company transferred to the new state
armory and the indoor meet drew nearly three thousand
spectators.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The cruise of 1910 was on the battleship
Louisiana and it carried the division around the
Island of Bermuda.  April 29 the division’s
crackerjack wall-scaling team won the world’s
championship, in the Twenty-third Regiment Armory in
Brooklyn, N. Y., over three competing teams.</p>

<h3 class='c022'><span class='sc'>The Fourth Division</span><br /> <span class='sc'>Naval Militia Connecticut National Guard</span></h3>

<p class='c023'>Soon after the forming of the First Division an
engineer force was outlined and then established and this
in time became known as an engineer division. The
organizing of the Second Division had its influence on
the so-called engineer division. In time the branch as a
separate organization seemed to lapse, although its
importance was increasing.</p>

<p class='c013'>In January, 1908, an artificer division was called for,
in an order from the adjutant-general’s office, to have a
maximum enlisted strength of forty, and Chief Engineer
William G. Hinckley was placed in command. Commander
Cornwell directed Mr. Hinckley and Assistant Engineer
Osborne A. Day to enlist and organize the division.
Warrant Machinists Noble, Rathgeber and Larkin of the
staff were to report to Mr. Hinckley for duty. Mr. Noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>was a Second Division alumnus. February 4 Mr. Hinckley
submitted the rates. Corinth L. LaRock of Hartford was
early appointed a chief machinist’s mate.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
